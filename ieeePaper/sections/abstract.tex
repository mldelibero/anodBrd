This paper presents a custom circuit for controlling the anodization of titanium capacitors and characterizing their performance. The circuitry provides a constant current source of 0-100mA up to a compliance voltage of 30V. The system can monitor and record leakage currents down to 10 nA over periods of up to 24 hours. Typical results obtained using sputtered titanium-zirconium capacitors are presented.
