\section{Experimental Procedure}
The experimental setup to anodize the anode of a titanium capacitor with the aforementioned circuitry is as follows. The anode sample is prepared by cleaning the surface oxide off with a chemical bath. It is then placed in a beaker of anodizing solution. The current source is connected to the DUT and acts as both a current source and data logger until the test is finished and the current through the DUT has dropped to the leakage current.
